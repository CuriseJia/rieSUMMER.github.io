I am now a final-year student at the Xiamen University, advised by Prof. [Chen Lin](https://cs.xmu.edu.cn/info/1008/1216.htm) and Dr. [Yeyun Gong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yegong/).

I am working as a research intern at [International Digital Economy Academy](https://idea.edu.cn/).

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Retrieval, Natural Language Generation, Numerical Reasoning and Knowledge-Augmented LLM. Specially, I aim to develop models exceed the level of human knowledge and have human reasoning capabilities.
