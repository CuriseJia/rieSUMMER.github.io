abstract: In the post-epidemic era, there is an urgent demand for the restoration of collaborative, open, and efficient learning. When individuals engage in learning within a community, collaborative learning based on community trust is an important intrinsic driver towards high-quality learning. How to fully harness the value and potential of the community in collaborative learning? This article first constructs a collaborative learning framework that promotes deep learning in learning communities, incorporating four core elements. During 12 weeks of blended online and offline learning practices, creating a learning community atmosphere, nurturing student collaboration skills, forming learning communities, implementing specific collaborative activities, and conducting learning evaluation and reflection have led to the development of a collaborative learning approach towards trust-based symbiosis. Results demonstrate that our exploration of collaborative learning teaching methods within learning communities is practical and highly effective.
