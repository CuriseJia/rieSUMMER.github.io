abstract: The development of the metaverse has been integrating metaverse technology into the current educational environment. To make metaverse technology better applied in mathematics education, we introduce four types of technologies in the metaverse and consider their application in mathematics teaching. However, how to make full use of the four categories in mathematics education needs to be further explored. Based on the literature review, we focused on the possibilities of the educational metaverse in the field of mathematical development. Taking the classic course “The Pythagorean Theorem” in mathematics as an example, we designed and experimented with new teaching methods in the context of the metaverse. We hope that through the study of our course, we can provide more theoretical support and reference for how the metaverse can promote the better development of mathematics teaching.
