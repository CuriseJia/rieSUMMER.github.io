abstract: The rapid development of ChatGPT technology has brought significant impact and challenges to the field of education. Many scholars have begun to explore the educational potential of ChatGPT and contemplate how to achieve a deep integration of education and technology through large-scale language models. In this regard, we investigated the transformative power of ChatGPT in education from the perspectives of historical context and the evolution of educational technology, indicating that 1) technology drived the discovery of educational laws; 2) ChatGPT reflected emergent features of complex systems; 3) technological transformation led to changes in knowledge representation, knowledge generation, forms and functionalities of educational tools, as well as educational concepts and methods. To further explore the deep applications of ChatGPT in education, we proposed a framework for constructing a knowledge graph of biological disciplines, which involved extracting knowledge through multi-turn question-and-answer sessions with ChatGPT and utilizing the Neo4j visual graph database to form a knowledge graph from the extracted knowledge repository.
