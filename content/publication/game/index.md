abstract: Based on the analysis of the application of gamified learning and metaverse, this study dissects the design principles of educational games. It introduces metaverse technology to analyze and design gamified learning. The game content is edited based on the process design using technologies such as VR and web platforms to realize the platform construction of the gamified learning scenario under the metaverse to enhance the immersion of the teaching game, the educational nature of the content, and the interactivity of the learners. On the one hand, this study aims to project the teaching content into an immersive scenario game, where learners can explore the educational teaching content by observing and immersing themselves in the whole scenario experience. On the other hand, an attempt is made to make educational games more diverse through meta-universe technology to provide diversified development paths for gamified learning and practical references for future teaching and learning development ideas.
