Paper: "APOLLO: An Optimized Training Approach for Long-form Numerical Reasoning"

We adopt a number-aware negative sampling strategy in retriever to discriminate key numerical facts from others. Moreover, we design consistency-based reinforcement learning with target program augmentation, to increase program diversity and ultimately increase the execution accuracy.

We acachieve **Global Rank 1** on ConvFinQA [Private Leaderboard](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/8582#results) !
