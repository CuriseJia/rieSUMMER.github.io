I am now a Research Engineer Intern at IDEA. I will start my M.S. program at USC next year.

I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Shenglin Zhang](http://nkcs.iops.ai/shenglinzhang/) at Nankai University. From March 2021-June 2021, I was advised by Dr. [Gary Becigeul](https://www.garybe.com/) from Gematria Technologies. From the 2021.7 until 2021.10 , I was a visiting student researcher advised by Professor [Ian Harris](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/) from UC, Irvine.

My research interests include deep learning, basically focus on natural language processing, dialogue system and open domain system.
